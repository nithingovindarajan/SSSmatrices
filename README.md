# SSS and CSS solvers

This repository contains Julia code to construct and solve Sequentially Semi Separable (SSS) and Cycle Semi Separable (CSS) matrices. This includes functions to convert a dense matrix into SSS and CSS form. In the case of CSS matrices, an overlapping minimum rank completion problem is solved.

## How to use this code


## Running tests

To run the tests, follow the following steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local workstation
2. Open Julia REPL inside root directory of this folder.
3. Type "]" to enter the package manager.
4. Type "test" and press enter
